<h2> 🎼 Music </h2>
<p>
I don't play an instrument but I spend my life listening to music! Walking with headphones on is the best way to feel free. I'm interested in a lot of artists of different styles and it's a field that attracts me a lot!

<h2>🩰🤺🏊🏻‍♀️🏋️ Sports</h2>
<p>
Since I was a little girl I have always practiced a lot of sports! I think I have tried almost all of them... Nevertheless I specialized in classical dance, I did 8 hours a week for more than 6 years, as well as fencing and I even participated in competitions. Since I am at Esses I just go to the gym.
